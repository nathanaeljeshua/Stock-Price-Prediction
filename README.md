# Stock-Price-Prediction
This is a personal project that I made and also used as my thesis to get my bachelor degree. I made a deep learning model to predict stock closed prices of a bank. Here, I used Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and optimized the hyperparameters using Grey Wold Optimizer.

The first program is about finding the best amount of population and the position of the alpha grey wolf where the position hat indicates the best hyperparameters based on the population. There are two hyperparameters that are optimized, total hidden layer of LSTM and learning rate. I ran the program 25 times to get the best 25 hyperparamaters.

The second and third programs are about training, testing, and evaluating the model using the best hyperparameter.
